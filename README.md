## Steps to Clearing a Structure

### Enter Structure to Gain Foothold

- 3 Threats to consider

        > Enemy Inside

        > Enemy Outside

        > Enemy Inside Engaging Friendly Forces Outside. 

- Use these three threats to decide where to enter. 

        > If suspecting Enemy inside, its favorable to enter from either roof, or breach hole in building. 

#### Two Types of Breaching 

##### Close-in Breach

- At side of building "Stacked"

##### Distant Breach

- At a distance. 

    > Example : Across alleyway from door. 

        > Clearing Team Stacked across. 

            > Moves safely to door once breach commences.

                > Quick, QUIET, already knows order. 
        
        > Breaching Team Split : 

            > 2 Breaching Members

            > 2 Support Members providing security. 

            > SL supervising and surveying reccomended cover. 

            > When Clearing Team moves to entry, provide cover
            
                > Suppressive fire

                > Smoke / other divisionary measures

#### Deciding breaching method 

- Factors on which breach type to perform. 

        > Type of building (Materials, etc)

            > Will Explosives Blow Up Building/Cause Collapse? 

        > Possible Fire

        > Dust/obstruction of vision. 

        > Presence of Civilians 

- Use above factors to determine which method: 

    > Gaining Entry : 

        > Explosive 

        > Large Caliber Firearms

        > Flashbang before entry (best)

        > Hand grenade (disadvantage: dust + debris for up to several minutes)

- These can be further classified into : 

    > Mechanical

        > Sledge Hammers

        > Crowbars

        > Applying hook to door attached to vehicle. 

    > Ballistic 

        > Small Arms

        > Shotguns

        > Rockets

    > Explosive

        > Fastest

        > Most Combat Effective Method

    > Manual

        > Foot/Shoulder

- Army Perferred Method (Per USARMY Field Manual)

    > Shotgun

        > Ease of Training 

        > Repetitive Use 

        > Speed

        > Minimal Collateral Damage 

- More breaching Options

    > Grenade Rifle Entry Munition

        > Useful 15-40 meters for wooden and (not reinforced) metal doors


    > Tank 25-120mm 

        > Lots of collateral. Only use to kill what is inside. 

### Room Clearing

- Definition of Room Clearing : "Seizing control of the room and its inhabitants"

    > Includes Hostiles & Civilians

        > Rapidly

        > Methodically

    > Must Control and Dominate situation

#### Planning

- SL or higher will finalize the plan 

    > Requires four fundamentals : 


        > Speed 

                > Swiftness (reacting to dynamic conditions)

                > Action

            > Perception

            > Distraction

        > Security 

            > Balancing speed, security and firepower

        > Surprise

            > Reduces Enemies Effectiveness

        > Shock (applying overwhelming violence)

            > Slows and Disrupts Enemy

#### Seeking Points of Domination 

- Typically Corner

    > Allows control with :

        > Observation 

        > Fire

    > Avoid : 

        > Doors

        > Windows

- Entering Building 

    > Alternating Order

        > Complementing Angles

#### In the Event of Multiple Rooms: 

    > Immediate preperation for follow-on mission should begin: 

        > follow-on room clearing

        > Heightened Observation

        > Possibly Establishing a defense.
